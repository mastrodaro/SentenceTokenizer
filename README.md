Set up
    Your solution must be written in Java version at least 1.7. Your application must be able to read from
    standard input and write onto standard output. Feel free to present your ability to use common tools,
    libs or frameworks (wiring, testing, logging, and building).
Functionality
    The basic requirement is to provide a program that can convert text into either XML formatted data or
    comma separated (CSV) data. The text is to be parsed, broken into sentences and words and the words
    have to be sorted.
    Create a domain model class Sentence.java, which will be used as a key in a Map.
    Code should be clean and testable. Unit tests must be provided as a formal verification of functional
    requirements.
    Consider huge input when dealing IO operations (entire dataset cannot fit in heap). For testing purposes
    try running your code against our file large.in with the following JVM argument: -Xmx32m
    The program must be able to read input text like:
    “Mary had a little lamb. Peter called for the wolf, and Aesop came.
    Cinderella likes shoes.”
    and parse this text into relevant model classes, and be able to convert the structure to both XML and
    CSV format.
    The parsing must break the text into sentences and words. The parser should allow some whitespace
    around words and delimiters, e.g. the following is allowed as input and should produce the same result
    as the first example:
    “ Mary had a little lamb .
    Peter called for the wolf , and Aesop came .
    Cinderella likes shoes..”
    In both cases the XML result should be like:
    <?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot;?>
    <text>
        <sentence>
            <word>a</word>
            <word>had</word>
            <word>lamb</word>
            <word>little</word>
            <word>Mary</word>
        </sentence>
        <sentence>
            <word>Aesop</word>
            <word>and</word>
            <word>called</word>
            <word>came</word>
            <word>for</word>
            <word>Peter</word>
            <word>the</word>
            <word>wolf</word>
        </sentence>
        <sentence>
            <word>Cinderella</word>
            <word>likes</word>
            <word>shoes</word>
        </sentence>
    </text>
    And the CSV result should likewise be:
    , Word 1, Word 2, Word 3, Word 4, Word 5, Word 6, Word 7, Word 8
    Sentence 1, a, had, lamb, little, Mary
    Sentence 2, Aesop, and, called, came, for, Peter, the, wolf
    Sentence 3, Cinderella, likes, shoes
